## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

Throughout my level I have generally tried to introduce each gameplay element (required & optional) in a way that conveys their function and possible dynamics as clearly as possible, so that players can then approach them in encounters later on with a complete understanding of how they might interact with them (ultimately allowing for more complex dynamics & encounters). For example, While section 3 features many other gameplay elements, the ultimate solution to each ‘Puzzle Room’ involves dropping a pushable block into a 2x2 tile hole such that it holds down a pressure plate and keeps a door open for the player to progress forward. Thus, I first introduce pushable blocks and the dynamic of them holding down pressure plates with a small introductory room at the very beginning of Section 3 (where all there is to do is push the block around & ultimately onto the plate in order to open the door). From there I build on the player’s understanding of pushable boxes & their dynamics gradually. First this is done by requiring the player to experiment with pushable boxes and uncover how they interact with each other & their basic environment (by making them push around multiple blocks in the same room, and arrange them in order to use two blocks as a bridge for the last one. Then the interaction between pushable boxes and further gameplay elements are explored in depth in the following rooms now that the player has a better understanding of pushable blocks on their own (e.g. using pushable blocks as platforms across acid, moving pushable blocks around with doors, using pushable blocks as elevation to jump to otherwise unreachable higher platforms).


### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

I placed a decent amount easily accessible of healing items around Section 1 as I didn’t want the player to necessarily find themselves struggling with what was intended to be a sort of introductory section, but in order to maintain a satisfying intensity curve I made sure to place them AFTER encounters with new dangerous gameplay elements, so they act as more a reward for besting the challenges as opposed to a shield that preemptively minimises the challenge / makes the outcome predictable. Section 2 probably has the most intricate intensity curve, as I designed it so that as players progress through it, their abilities to backtrack and/or access healing is limited at certain points where fights are intended to be more intense. For example, if a player chose to defeat the enemies in the first Bonus Path and there are health pickups remaining at the bottom, the door will close behind them when they enter the big arena-style room that comes right after. This then prevents them from running back for cover mid-fight to recuperate and/or heal, but upon finishing that fight the door opens again, and they can once again return to make use of those health pickup rewards. While it applies more heavily to the later rooms than those at the beginning, I designed each ‘puzzle room’ in Section 3 in a way that players are liable to walk around and observe as much of it as they can while they actively analyse it to try and identify possible actions / solutions. Thus the intensity/drama is built as players’ gradually unravel the mystery & function of each room, and it all comes to a head with the rewarding “aha!” moment they have when they identify the ultimate solution.


### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

While Section 1 is relatively less challenging, and primarily serves to introduce key gameplay elements, I made an effort to pace/position them in a way that allows for a gradually increasing — yet still modulated / varied — difficulty curve. I primarily did so by introducing some more simple gameplay elements before more complicated ones (e.g. stationary obstacles such as spikes, acid, and pitfalls on the first floor, and moving platforms, distinct enemy types, and interactable switches on the second floor). Due to its focus on combat encounters (and thus, level of additional reliance on players’ mechanical ability), I opted to just have each MAIN encounter generally increase in difficulty when designing around the difficulty curve of Section 2. The way I elected to implement variance throughout the difficulty curve was by providing the option of optional Bonus Paths at various points throughout Section 2, which serve to provide players with a chance to temporarily divert from the MAIN path and instead take on a few additional enemies/challenges in exchange for more than enough pickups to restore all their health. With section 3 being more based around problem solving / puzzle gameplay than the other two sections, I mainly increased the difficulty to keep players in the flow state by gradually increasing the complexity of each room’s respective puzzles. Additionally, I gradually introduce more threats to the puzzle rooms as they progress (e.g. nothing to damage the player in the first room, acid pits introduced in the second room, & objects that actively push the player off of platforms and into acid in the final puzzle room), while also dropping some opportunities for healing around the rooms too.


### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

While designing the structure of each section in my level, I generally kept to the mindset that player’s main progression (that is to say, forward progress made directly towards reaching each of the 3 keys) would need to occasionally be halted by roadblocks with concrete & more involved solutions — in order to prevent players from simply rushing through the entire level as fast as possible without fully engaging with each encounter. With that said, I was also aware that following this rule too strictly / enforcing it too often could lead to player movement becoming so linear that the fun that stems from exploration & player agency is lost. Thus I approached the process of designing each section of my level with a slightly different degree of adherence to this principle, in addition to considering different methods to enable / incentivise player exploration in each section. Section 1 is fairly simple and unrestricted in how players are able to explore it, relative to the two sections that follow it. Aside from the lift that takes players down to the second half of the level (and not back up), players are completely free at all times to explore & move through anywhere in the level that they have previously been. In contrast, Section 2 more frequently limits players’ capacity to backtrack (e.g. preventing them from abandoning a fight to run back and collect previous health pickups), and Section 3 is broken up into essentially 3 main rooms which all act as unique encounters (which are separated by brief one-time elevator rides for the sake of clarity). Given the introductory nature of Section 1, I decided to implement several opportunities for player agency that reward exploration, two of which specifically reflect the respective level designs of Sections 2 & 3. Early on when passthrough platforms are first introduced, I placed two health pickups at the bottom of the pit which is relatively easy to jump over without falling into. Aside from acting as a likely needed boost for any less-skilled players who fall in there unintentionally, this serves to convey to any player who happens to check down there that taking alternate paths with additional obstacles can yield additional rewards (in this case health pickups). This is reflective of Section 2, which is more combat focused, but offers multiple opportunities for players to divert from the main path to try and take on additional enemies in exchange for a reward of many health pickups. Later players will reach a point where their forward momentum is halted by a distant switch that they can’t reach (in order to activate it) by jumping over the gap between them. Here players are encouraged to explore other sections of the level instead of simply continuing in a straight line as they (mostly) previously had been, upon which they can obtain the Gun weapon which is the key to enabling their forward progress once again. This instance instead reflects Section 3 (which is more focused on problem solving / puzzle-style gameplay), wherein players’ movement throughout each of the 3 main rooms is far less linear, and players will generally need to explore alternate routes / return to previous locations in order to complete an overall puzzle that unlocks progression to the next room. In addition to this side of each section’s level design, I made an effort to ensure that the visual identity of each area is able to remain distinct & memorable, in a way that helps to guide the player’s understanding of the level. The visuals of Section 1 entirely reflect a sort of dark, abandoned cavern, with its low lighting, and an abundance of overgrown vines, moss, weeds, that are accompanied only by further grime and giant empty cobwebs. While section 2 also features an abundance of plant life, it almost entirely does away with the more familiar varieties seen in Section 1, in exchange for all manner of alien flora (to match the countless alien enemies that litter its rooms). Each main stretch of Section 2 (that is to say, each room/set of rooms that serve to introduce/provide the same basic challenge) is themed slightly differently, the most notable of which being the two Bonus Paths, which are optional alternate paths that the player can take in order to access the wealth of health pickups found past a slew of extra enemies. These bonus paths are much brighter and vibrant than the most of Section 2, and both share the same visual identity distinct plant life, making them easily identifiable amidst the rest of the section. Similarly to Section 1, Section 3 is generally consistent in its visual design for its duration, but it remains distinct from Sections 2 & 3. This is primarily a result of its overall much brighter lighting, and its much more angular & arid aesthetic — with most of the ground completely dried up & cracked, geometric carvings littering the walls of each room, and exposed / withered roots all around the place.


## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Spikes

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Spikes — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I chose to introduce the first spike like I did because I wanted the first real obstacle to be as simple as possible, to most clearly convey the idea that the player will need to consider their own abilities/resources to progress through the level. I wanted to make sure a small ledge (that must be jumped over) also came just before the first spike, just to make SURE that the player first understands their ability to JUMP over obstacles. I also decided to include the small patch of spikes after the first singular one, to ensure the player understands that spikes will damage them from any angle and not just from the sides before proceeding (in case they didn’t already intuit that and jump over them).

### 2.2. Acid

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Acid — Storyboard FULL.png>)
Given I only planned to implement acid into my level as a hazard that players must avoid falling into, I decided I would keep its introduction simple like this. I also decided it should be not far from where the player would respawn, to make sure they aren’t taken out of the flow state by needing to repeat a long stretch of past encounters after falling to the acid.

### 2.3. Checkpoints

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Checkpoint — Storyboard FULL.png>)
Seeing as acid is the only obstacle that can actually send the player back to a checkpoint I thought it only made sense to introduce them somewhat together. I wanted to allow some opportunity for the player to see that they will respawn at their default spawn point if they never activate a checkpoint, so I included the singular acid pit before the first checkpoint. Also, to reinforce that checkpoints CHANGE that, I included two slightly more difficult acid pits straight after the first checkpoint so that the player has an increased chance of falling into acid AFTER activating it (upon which they would of course immediately see how checkpoints work).

### 2.4. Passthrough Platforms

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Passthrough Platforms — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I thought that placing the platforms in a pit for use in climbing back up would be good, as any player who falls in would effectively be FORCED to see that they can pass through them. I thought it would also be useful though to include a section later in the level that would FORCE players to engage with passthrough platforms (by both jumping up AND falling down through them).

### 2.5. Health Pickups

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Health Pickups — Storyboard FULL.png>)
While thinking about the structure of the level loosely in my head at first, I thought including the health pickups after the second obstacle would potentially work better than just the first, as I wanted a slightly higher chance for the player to see early on that they will reset to the default spawn point when losing all health, without them then having to replay a long stretch of level that they had previously cleared.

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Moving Platform — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I wasn’t sure if I would need to include a simple lift or something before I would introduce moving platforms like this, but even so I thought it would be a good idea to have at least the 2nd encounter with moving platforms be structured like this, where the player must more actively engage with it. I figured implementing it like this, where understanding the movement of the platform is needed to progress past it, would be most effective as it forces players to stop and process how they work (and how to potentially interact with them).

### 2.7. Chompers

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Chompers — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I decided it would be a good idea to introduce the chomper before the spitter, and before any weapons, as the ranged attacks of the spitter are a bit more complex to immediately understand (& they deal contact damage like chompers anyway), and I wanted to make sure the player would get the chance to see how they attack and understand the threat/s they pose (before just killing them instantly).

### 2.8. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Staff Pickup — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I decided introducing the staff like this was the best idea, as I figured it made sense to introduce it more or less right after the first chomper, but I wanted to make sure the player had to actually use the staff to progress undamaged instead of just jumping over them (in case the previous chomper encounter led them to the understanding that jumping over enemies was always the best/intended solution to passing enemies).

### 2.9. Spitters

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Spitters — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I wanted to place multiple spitters at different distances, where the player would have to stop / move slower at points, so that they had a better chance of observing how you have to enter the vision of a spitter before it will begin attacking. I also decided I should have multiple enemies in different spots so they cannot all be killed before the player has a chance to see them attack (due to the time it initially takes them to begin attacking). I also wanted to place some underneath platforms to make it more likely that the player would see how the projectiles can move THROUGH otherwise solid elements.

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Gun Pickup — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I decided this would be an effective way to introduce the gun, as it would force the player to use it, while introducing its capacity to not only kill distant enemies, but also turn on distant switches. I thought the latter would be a valuable extra lesson to teach from the get-go, as I had a few ideas from the beginning on how I might use that dynamic later on in the level.

### 2.11. Keys

![Place any alt text here](DocImages/<Keys — Storyboard FULL.png>)
I thought it only made sense to have the keys serve as a sort of final reward for clearing each section, and so I decided to introduce the gameplay element at the very end of Section 1 (once all its obstacles had been surpassed). I also figured that because I wouldn’t be explaining the function of keys using text or anything else like that, ensuring that the player sees the built-in visual feedback of the key door lighting up when they collect their first key would be the most effective way possible to communicate the role/function of keys within the level.

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.


By designing my level with an iterative approach, as opposed to a more rigid & entirely pre-planned one, I was able to gradually uncover new and more interesting possibilities for my level throughout the process of putting it together. Additionally, I was able to constantly update my plans each time I identified a potential issue or otherwise detrimental aspect of my level’s design. Thus, I was able to constantly & actively adapt the design of my level as I put it all together, ultimately resulting in a much more cohesive and effective design than any of the plans I formulated at the beginning of the process. When beginning to design each new section it was always a little daunting early on as I found myself naturally trying to consider larger aspects of its design such as the space it would occupy, or how each encounter would fit together. With that said, it became a much more fluid and accessible process when I instead sat down and approached the design from the ground up. For example, while it was extremely difficult to try and visualise / plan out the structure of each ‘Puzzle Room’ in Section 3 to begin with, when I took the time to just draw up / list a bunch of simple & small-scale interactions, I was then able to just figure out how some of them might be tied together, and I was able to ultimately fit each one together into their own unique puzzles with relative ease (instead of trying to think up each interaction & how they all connect, entirely from the get-go).

Examples of these early interaction designs (and how they were later combined into singular 'puzzle rooms' for Section 3:

While I used the mind-map style structure of molecule diagrams when plotting out certain portions of my level, I never ended up making one to connect all 3 sections of my level. While I don't know how much it might've helped me actually build my level given that I designed each different section to be deliberately separate & distinct (with players being able to access the latter two sections in whatever order they please), I'm sure it would've allowed me to understand each section better from a theory perspective, which I acknowledge could've potentially guided me towards some improvements I otherwise haven't considered.
